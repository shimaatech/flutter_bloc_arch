# example

An example of using the flutter_bloc_arch library

## Getting Started

This example demonstrates how to use the flutter_bloc_arch library by building a simple app
for showing a movies list and adding them to favorite list. For more info please refer to the 
library [repository] or to the [docs]

**The app is fully documented, so that there is almost no need to explain anything here**.

## App contents

**The app contains 2 pages**:
- Movies Page: Shows a list of all the available movies in the repository with the ability to add
movies to the favorite list and to filter them according to the genre.
- Favorite Movies Page: Shows the favorite movies with the ability to remove them from the favorite
list

**The app contains 4 `Components`**:
- A Component for the `Movies Page`
- A Component for the `Favorite Movies Page`
- A Component for the `App Home` (A home page wrapper)
- A shared component (`MovieItem`) that is used by both the `Movies Page` and the `Favorite Movies Page`
